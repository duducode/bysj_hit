    output_stride, which is the ratio of the input to output spatial resolution.

    This function generates a family of ResNet v2 models. See the resnet_v2_*()
    methods for specific model instantiations, obtained by selecting different
    block instantiations that produce ResNets of various depths.
    Training for image classification on Imagenet is usually done with [224, 224]
    inputs, resulting in [7, 7] feature maps at the output of the last ResNet
    block for the ResNets defined in [1] that have nominal stride equal to 32.
    However, for dense prediction tasks we advise that one uses inputs with
    spatial dimensions that are multiples of 32 plus 1, e.g., [321, 321]. In
    this case the feature maps at the ResNet output will have spatial shape
    [(height - 1) / output_stride + 1, (width - 1) / output_stride + 1]
    and corners exactly aligned with the input image corners, which greatly
    facilitates alignment of the features to the image. Using as input [225, 225]
    images results in [8, 8] feature maps at the output of the last ResNet block.
    For dense prediction tasks, the ResNet needs to run in fully-convolutional
    (FCN) mode and global_pool needs to be set to False. The ResNets in [1, 2] all
    have nominal stride equal to 32 and a good choice in FCN mode is to use
    output_stride=16 in order to increase the density of the computed features at
    small computational and memory overhead, cf. http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00915.
    Args:
      inputs: A tensor of size [batch, height_in, width_in, channels].
      blocks: A list of length equal to the number of ResNet blocks. Each element
        is a resnet_utils.Block object describing the units in the block.
      num_classes: Number of predicted classes for classification tasks. If None
        we return the features before the logit layer.
      is_training: whether is training or not.
      global_pool: If True, we perform global average pooling before computing the
        logits. Set to True for image classification, False for dense prediction.
      output_stride: If None, then the output will be computed at the nominal
        network stride. If output_stride is not None, it specifies the requested
        ratio of input to output spatial resolution.
      include_root_block: If True, include the initial convolution followed by
        max-pooling, if False excludes it. If excluded, `inputs` should be the
        results of an activation-less convolution.
      spatial_squeeze: if True, logits is of shape [B, C], if false logits is
          of shape [B, 1, 1, C], where B is batch_size and C is number of classes.
          To use this parameter, the input images must be smaller than 300x300
          pixels, in which case the output logit layer does not contain spatial
          information and can be removed.
      reuse: whether or not the network and its variables should be reused. To be
        able to reuse 'scope' must be given.
      scope: Optional variable_scope.
